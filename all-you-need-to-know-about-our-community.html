                <h2>WHAT IS DISCORD?</h2>
                <p>Discord is a free voice, video, and text chat app that's used by tens of millions of people ages 13+ to talk and hang out with their communities and friends.</p>

                <p>People use Discord daily to talk about many things, ranging from art projects and family trips to homework and mental health support. It's a home for communities of any size, but it's most widely used by small and active groups of people
                    who talk regularly.</p>

                <p>The vast majority of servers are private, invite-only spaces for groups of friends and communities to stay in touch and spend time together. There are also larger, more open communities, generally centered around specific topics such as
                    popular games like Minecraft and Fortnite. All conversations are opt-in, so people have total control over who they interact with and what their experience on Discord is.</p>

                <p>People love Discord because it's a home for all their communities and groups of friends. It's a place where they can be themselves and spend time with other people who share their interests and hobbies. There's no algorithm deciding what
                    they should see, no endless scrolling, and no news feed. Conversations on Discord are driven by shared interests.</p>

            <h2>Why You Should Join Schooling Made Easy Community Server?</h2>
            <p>Schooling Made Easy community server is majorly built to bring undergraduates from different learning institutes together so as to facilitate easy communication among different individuals around the World. The server has several categories
                and channels built to serve the main purpose behind it's creation. Following are the explanations to each category and channels. </p>
            <h4>The Main Category</h4>
            <p>The main category has 6 different channels dedicated to different purposes.</p>
            <ul id="category-discord" class="category-discord">
                <li>
                    <strong>
                <a class="category-links "  href="https://discord.gg/sNwbXGA3 ">#introduce-yourself</a>
                </strong>
                    <p class="intro">
                        channel is dedicated to new members. This channel will be made mandatory for every new member so as to know their names, country, school, course, hobbies e.t.c.
                        <em>Note: it's not necessary to discuss everything noted above, it's totally fine to keep discrete information personal to you.</em>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        <a class="category-links" href="https://discord.gg/PGqawUAZ">#general</a>
                    </strong>
                    <p class="intro">
                        channel is for general purpose chatting. Absolutely anything can be discussed here so far it <strong>doesn't violate the community rules and regulations.</strong>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><a class="category-links" href="https://discord.gg/hGBJTsW6">#naija-school-gist</a></strong>
                    <p class="intro">

                        channel is solely made for Nigerian undergraduates. We believe learning is fun and we made this channel specifically for updates or news or trending information across Nigeria learning institutions (Universities, Polytechnics, College of educations, and
                        many more.)
                    </p>

                    <p class="intro">

                        channel is very similar to naija-school-gist, but we create this channel to discuss trending information in our discord server itself. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><a class="category-links" href="https://discord.gg/tK5AWhtW">#what-do-you-think</a></strong>
                    <p class="intro">

                        channel is created for special debates, arguments, or talks. Members who have topics up for arguments or just pure discussion will have a great time in here.
                    </p>

            <h4>The Stay Accountable Category</h4>
            <p>This category is meant to declare goals and do them. There are two major channels in this category</p>

                    <p class="intro">

                    I learned how to make a website " etc. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Other Major categories</h4>
            <p>

                    <p>Discord bots are the most useful features that we use to perform a wide range of automated tasks on the server. For instance, we use the bots to welcome new members to the server or assign them roles. These AI-fueled bots enable us
                        easily personalize experience, moderate communications between members, and ban people who don't abide by the rules and guidelines of our community</p>

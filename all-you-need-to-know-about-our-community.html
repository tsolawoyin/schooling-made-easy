            <h2>WHAT IS DISCORD?</h2> 
            <p>Discord is a free voice, video, and text chat app that's used by tens of millions of people ages 13+ to talk and hang
            out with their communities and friends.</p>
            
            <p>People use Discord daily to talk about many things, ranging from art projects and family trips to homework and mental
            health support. It's a home for communities of any size, but it's most widely used by small and active groups of people
            who talk regularly.</p>
            
            <p>The vast majority of servers are private, invite-only spaces for groups of friends and communities to stay in touch and
            spend time together. There are also larger, more open communities, generally centered around specific topics such as
            popular games like Minecraft and Fortnite. All conversations are opt-in, so people have total control over who they
            interact with and what their experience on Discord is.</p>
            
            <p>People love Discord because it's a home for all their communities and groups of friends. It's a place where they can be
            themselves and spend time with other people who share their interests and hobbies. There's no algorithm deciding what
            they should see, no endless scrolling, and no news feed. Conversations on Discord are driven by shared interests.</p>

            <h2>Why You Should Join Schooling Made Easy Community Server?</h2>
            <p>Schooling Made Easy community server is majorly built to bring undergraduates from different learning institutes together so as to facilitate easy communication among different individuals around the World. The server has several categories and channels built to serve the main purpose behind it's creation. Following are the explanations to each category and channels. </p>
            <h4>The Main Category</h4>
            <p>The main category has 6 different channels dedicated to different purposes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>><a href="https://discord.gg/sNwbXGA3">#introduce-yourself</a></strong> channel is dedicated to new members. This channel will be made mandatory for every new member so as to know their names, country, school, course, hobbies e.t.c. <em>Note: it's not necessary to discuss everything noted above, it's totally fine to keep discrete information personal to you.</em></li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://discord.gg/PGqawUAZ">#general</a></strong> channel is for general purpose chatting. Absolutely anything can be discussed here so far it <strong>doesn't violate the community rules and regulations.</strong></li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://discord.gg/hGBJTsW6">#naija-school-gist</a></strong> channel is solely made for Nigerian undergraduates. We believe learning is fun and we made this channel specifically for updates or news or trending information across Nigeria learning institutions (Universities, Polytechnics, College of educations, and many more.) </li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://discord.gg/6PFUUjKf">#trending</a></strong> channel is very similar to naija-school-gist, but we create this channel to discuss trending information in our discord server itself.</li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://discord.gg/tK5AWhtW">#what-do-you-think</a></strong> channel is created for special debates, arguments, or talks. Members who have topics up for arguments or just pure discussion will have a great time in here. </li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://discord.gg/KKVtbpmx">#sme-support</a></strong> channel is for lodging complains directly to the moderators. Please feel free to also report here anyone who has violated the commnuity codes of conduct. And be rest assured that appropriate measures shall be taken.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Stay Accountable Category</h4>
            <p>This category is meant to declare goals and do them. There are two major channels in this category</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><a href="https://discord.gg/fNwGdN8z">#today-i-will</a></strong> is where members declare goals. For example, "today-i-will read part of my anatomy lecture notes", "today, I will learn how to make a website" etc. </li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://discord.gg/sRYtMBxh">#today-i-did</a></strong> is where members tell the community the goals they actually fulfilled. For example, "today-i-did read part of my anatomy lecture notes", "today, I learned how to make a website" etc. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Other Major categories</h4>

            <h2 id="reasons">Reasons why we choose Discord</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>AI-Powered Bots:</h4>
                    <p>Discord bots are the most useful features that we use to perform a wide range of automated tasks on the server. For
                    instance, we use the bots to welcome new members to the server or assign them roles. These AI-fueled bots
                    enable us easily personalize experience, moderate communications between members, and ban people who don't abide by
                    the rules and guidelines of our community</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Personalized Welcome Screens:</h4>
                    <p>Using the Discord community server, we are able to set up personalized welcome screens in order to create a great onboarding
                    experience and introduce users to what our community is all about. This helps our visitors to easily navigate through
                    our channels without feeling lost.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Announcement Channels:</h4>
                    <p>Unlike other traditional text channel, Announcement Channels allow us to show our messages beyond our server. The
                    “Follow” button enables server members to integrate the channel with their own personal servers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Community Discovery:</h4>
                    <p>Setting up our community directly on Discord's server discovery enables us to make it more visible to our target
                    audience.</p>

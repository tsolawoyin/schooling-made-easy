        <article><p>My name is Oladapo Moses Gbenga aka Opa. I am a medical student of the Obafemi Awolowo University, ile-ife. I am an
        advocate for quality education for sustainable development, and I am also privileged to be one of the initiators of this
        great initiative called <strong>Schooling Made Easy initiative</strong>. I know you might have been thinking of what the mission
        of the initiative is all about. Questions highlighted below must definitely be going through your mind.</p>
        <h2>What do we do?</h2>
        <p>The initiative and its growing community is serving as an access road where intellectual people with achiling beautiful
        opinions can come together to discuss burning issues as regards to our society. It is not a new thing that a lot of
        people have blinkered approaches and policies as regards to ongoing activities in the world, so the community is trying
        to erase the non-productive conservative mindset of the people by showing the possible solutions to some of these
        problems.</p>
        <h2>How do we do it?</h2>
        <p>Well, like we all know that team work divides the effort and multiply the effect. So team work makes the dream work. We
        aim at bringing people of like minds together as a team so that member of the team can add values to one another and to
        other people out there through scheduled discussions and plans irrespective of the field of study or area of
        specialization and people in the same sphere of life and with similar objective get to know one another through our
        Discord community and thereby help in the growth of the community and subsequently influence the society positively.</p>
        <h2>Who do we do it for?</h2>
        <p>The initiative is for everyone who wishes to become a better version of himself/herself. Andrew Carnegie, the
        Scotish-American industrialist says <strong><em>"is no use whatever trying to help poeple who do not help themselves, you
        cannot push anyone up a ladder unless the person is willing to climb himself".</em></strong> Almost everyone wants to become better
        but not everyone has the right information and association to be better. So we are creating a medium and community where
        essential information for personal and societal development can be sourced from.</p>
        <h2>What values are we bringing?</h2>
        <p>We are redefining the learning culture of the people by modifying the unyeilding conservative mindset of the people to a
        more resourceful mindset. Our goal as a team is to help others unlock and direct their deepest motivator using
        pragmatical approaches.</p>
        <p>Don't wait to get started. Dawson Trotman once said, "the greatest time wasted is the time getting started", and don't
        forget the chinese proverb which says "a man who delibrate fully before taking a step will spend his entire life on one
        leg".</p>
